# Restaurant-Reviews-App
The project is part of Udacity's FEND course.


The goal was to add a responsive layout via CSS to support different views across different devices, as well as to create a service worker to display the sites content without internet accessibility.

## Getting Started
To run the project, download or clone the repository to your computer:`$ git clone https://github.com/FelixLutze/Restaurant-Reviews-App/`

Youl'll need your own [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) key in order to make use of the implemented map.

Copy your key into the existing api links in the script tag of both files (restaurant.html & index.html).


Navigate into the projectfolder and run the following command to start a HTTP-Server via the shell and python:
`python3 -m http.server 8000`

Now you can access the project by typping `localhost:8000` into the adress bar of your desired browser.
